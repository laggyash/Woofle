# Woofle 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Team Shibu

### Project Description
Woofle is a dog matchmaking site with a twist—matches are made purely based on the owner's details, ignoring any information about the dogs themselves!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Woofle addresses the completely imaginary issue of “owner-dog compatibility.”

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Woofle’s "solution"? Ignore the dogs’ needs and quirks completely and use this “groundbreaking” approach to ensure owners feel reassured that their own personalities are the basis for their pet's relationships.
